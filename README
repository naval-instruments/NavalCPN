1.  Abstract
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NavalCPN is a modified version of OpenCPN. Keep in mind that
the kernel of this project is OpenCPN, and we owe them a lot
of credits for this.
OpenCPN is an Open-Sourced project, so is NavalCPN. As it is
under GPLv3, you can freely download the source and reuse it
at other purposes. There are, however, few conditions to follow
and you can find them in the LICENSE files.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Overview
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NavalCPN is a tool which is part of a series of hardware and
software modules developped by Naval Instruments.
This software will allow you to ease your sailing experience.
Thanks to the hardware provided by NI, you will be able to
get a deeper overview of your boat than with regular OpenCPN.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Update Policy
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As NavalCPN is clearly distinct from OpenCPN, there might be
few differences when it comes to stability, features, and look
of the software. Naval Instruments tries its best to keep the
kernel Up-To-Date with OpenCPN's releases. It may also happen
that NavalCPN's Kernel is in advance compare to last OpenCPN
release, which might cause stability issues.
The process of upgrading the kernel, while keeping the modifications
can be long and tedious. Thus feel free to help the good cause,
it's an Open-Sourced project after all!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Warning
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NavalCPN is not a complete replacement to traditionnal ways of
sailing. Naval Instruments cannot be charged for accident that
happened while using NavalCPN, nor OpenCPN. We assume that you
know how a sailboat works, and that you are responsible of your
acts.
